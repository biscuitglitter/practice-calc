# practice-calc

I got stuck doing my calculator project, so i'm going through the source code of the calculator built in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vg4EiYPCUc.<br>
I'm explaining it to myself line by line, and later will go back and try to write the javascript of my own calculator and make it work. <br>
